I'd like to share this Northwind Traders Performance Dashboard developed in Power BI. I used the dataset from Maven Data Challenge provided by Maven Analytics. I created the Manager and Country filters using a new Power BI feature called the updated Button Slicer. As of now, I've developed multiple Power BI dashboards, and with each dashboard, I'm learning new features and capabilities of Power BI. Power BI's formatting options have impressed me. I have made a new UX design for Category filter that is far more effective to the default slicer design.
